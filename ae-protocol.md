Overview
========

The AE protocol works by exchanging messages between the Amiga and the Client (e.g. an IBM PC).

Each message consists of a header and optionally payload data. Both parts carry CRC32 checksums
to ensure data integrity.

Message header
--------------

| Bytes          | Content                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 2              | Msg (see below)              |
| 2              | Payload length               |
| 4              | Sequence                     |
| 4              | CRC32                        |

Payload (if any)
----------------

| Bytes          | Content                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| n              | Payload                      |
| 4              | CRC32                        |

Each message is acknowledged by the receiving side by a 4-Byte "PkOk" response if the checksum matches, "PkRs" otherwise.

Recovery from checksum errors: on "PkRs" non-ack, the sending side re-sends the whole message until "PkOk" is received.
FIXME: is this correct?

Message types
=============

| Msg  | ID                | Sending side | Description                                               |

Multipart data will be polled in chunks using 0x00 MSG_NEXT_PART. This data is structured as follows:

| Bytes          | Content                      |

0x65 MSG_FILE_SEND - Read a file
--------------------------------

Payload: filename\0

Expected response: 0x08 MSG_IOERR if file cannot be opened, 0x03 MSG_MPARTH otherwise


0x66 MSG_FILE_RECV - Write a file (Client -> Amiga)
---------------------------------------------------

Payload:

| Bytes          | Content                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |

Expected response: 0x00 MSG_NEXT_PART if file does not exist (yet), 0x08
MSG_IOERR otherwise. 

If this is a regular file, file contents will be transferred using 0x03
MSG_MPARTH/0x05 MSG_BLOCK. Once file is transferred completely, 0x6d
MSG_FILE_CLOSE will be sent by the client. If this is a directory, 0x6d
MSG_FILE_CLOSE will be sent by the client right away.

0x67 MSG_FILE_DELETE - File/dir delete (recursively)
----------------------------------------------------

Payload:

| Bytes          | Content                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| n              | Path                         |
| 1              | 0x00                         |

Expected response: 0x00 MSG_NEXT_PART. Then, 0xa MSG_FILE_CLOSE.

If Path is a dir, it will be deleted together with its contents.


0x68 MSG_FILE_RENAME - Rename file/dir
--------------------------------------

Payload:

| Bytes          | Content                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| n              | Path (including old file name) |
| 1              | 0x00                           |
| m              | New file name (without path)   |
| 1              | 0x00                           |

Expected response: 0x00 MSG_NEXT_PART. Then, send 0x6d MSG_FILE_CLOSE.

Seems to work on volumes (disk rename), too.

0x69 MSG_FILE_MOVE - File move (path changes)
---------------------------------------------

Payload:

| Bytes          | Content                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| n              | Path (including old file name)                                     |
| 1              | 0x00                                                               |
| m              | New path to contain file (dir without trailing slash or file name) |
| 1              | 0x00                                                               |
| 1              | 0xc9 FIXME (?)                                                     |

Expected response: 0x00 MSG_NEXT_PART. Then, send 0x6d MSG_FILE_CLOSE (0xa response: 5x 00).

If Path is a directory, it will be moved together with its contents.
This command appears to work across devices.


0x6a MSG_FILE_COPY - File copy
------------------------------

Payload:

| Bytes  | Content                                                            |

| n      | Path (including old file name)                                     |
| 1      | 0x00                                                               |
| m      | New path to contain file (dir without trailing slash or file name) |
| 1      | 0x00                                                               |
| 1      | 0xc9 FIXME (?)                                                     |

Expected response: 0x00 MSG_NEXT_PART. Then, send 0x6d MSG_FILE_CLOSE (0xa response: 5x 00).

If Path is a directory, it will be copied together with its contents.
This command appears to work across devices.


0x6b MSG_FILE_ATTR - Set attributes and comment
-----------------------------------------------

Payload:

| Bytes | Content                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4     | Attributes                                                         |
| n     | Path                                                               |
| 1     | 0x00                                                               |
| m     | Comment                                                            |
| 1     | 0x00                                                               |
| 4     | Checksum? (seems to be 0x00000000 if comment empty) FIXME          |

Expected response: 0x00 MSG_NEXT_PART. Then, send 0x6d MSG_FILE_CLOSE (0xa response: 5x 00).


6c - Request size on disk (?)
------------------------------------

Payload:

     Bytes | Content
    -------|--------------------
         n | Path
         1 | 0x00

Then, read type 0 for confirmation.
Then, read type 9 for 12 bytes of payload (### TODO ###).
Then, send type 0 to request more data (no payload).
Then, read type 9 for 12 bytes of payload (### TODO ###).
Then, send type 0 to request more data (no payload).
Then, read type 0 signaling end of attributes (no payload).
Then, sendClose() (0xa response: 5x 00).

OR

Then, read type 0 for confirmation.
Then, read type 0 signaling end of attributes (no payload).
Then, sendClose() (0xa response: 5x 00).



0x6d MSG_FILE_CLOSE - Close file
--------------------------------

No payload.

Then, read type 0x0a MSG_ACK_CLOSE for confirmation (typical payload: 5 bytes of 0x00).

This is used to finish an operation, such as a directory listing
or renaming a file.


6e - Format disk
-----------------

### TODO ###


6f - New directory
------------------

Payload:

     Bytes |  Content
    -------|--------------------
         n | Parent path
         1 | 0x00

Then, read type 0 for confirmation.
Then, sendClose() (0xa response: 5x 00).

The host will create a new directory in the given path, together with a
matching .info file.
The directory name cannot be chosen, and will be something like "Unnamed1".

To create a directory with a specific name, use 0x66.
Note that 0x66'ing a directory does not seem to set its time.
